# Frequently Asked Questions
## Q: Why the name?
I bought the domain (`loli.lgbt`) a while ago as a joke and have had nothing to do with it since then. It used to just [redirect to my website](https://tomat.dev/).

## Q: Isn't this a bit much?
Yes.

## Q: Do you want to associate with lolicons?
No.
